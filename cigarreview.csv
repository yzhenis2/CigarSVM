"H. Upmann No. 2Jan 01, 2023",98,"6 1/8""",52,Medium,Figurado,"It might be one of the best-kept secrets in the Cuban cigar world, as the typical Cuban cigar smoker tends to overlook the H. Upmann No. 2 for its more popular counterpart, the Montecristo No. 2. Because the two cigars are rolled in the same pirámide format, comparisons are going to be inevitable. Both share the exact same dimensions, but they don’t have nearly the same star power. Some smokers tend to come around to Upmann after going through the more common Cuban standards, so it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call the H. Upmann No. 2 an insider’s cigar. Nor would it be the first time that this cigar has made it to our Top 25 list, as we’ve often recognized it as a smoke of complexity, nuance and character. This year, we found the H. Upmann No. 2 to be the most exceptional cigar of 2022. 

Like many Cuban cigar brands that are still on the market today, H. Upmann has a long history that spans more than 178 years and has managed to thrive despite changes in ownership, bankruptcy and a political revolution that resulted in H. Upmann becoming property of the state. To say it’s a survivor would be putting it mildly. The brand is an understated icon. 

H. Upmann was started in 1844 by German banker and financier Hermann Upmann, who had owned and operated a branch in Havana and manufactured cigars as well. His bank eventually went insolvent and H. Upmann was acquired by British distribution company J. Frankau & Co. In 1937, the brand ended up with Menendez y Garcia, the same company that produced Montecristos. The enormous success of Montecristo is what allowed Menendez y Garcia to keep the H. Upmann brand alive. When Fidel Castro nationalized the cigar industry in 1960, H. Upmann became property of the state and has been owned by the government ever since. 

Made in Havana, the H. Upmann No. 2 is sometimes misunderstood and dismissed as being too mild. It may not have been blended for strength, but smoking this cigar is a fully engaging experience with a room-filling aroma and mouth-filling texture that allows one to luxuriate in its layers of nutmeg, cinnamon and salted peanut flavor, all of which intensify, while, at the same time, showing a delicate floral quality that adds superb balance in a way that no other cigar this year could."

The Cohiba 55 Aniversario Edición Limitada 2021 got the world’s attention not just because it’s a Cohiba, and not because it celebrates the brand’s 55th anniversary. It turned heads because of the exorbitant price tag—$300 per cigar. The Cohiba came a bit late and wasn’t released until 2022, first in Lebanon and Cyprus and then later in Havana with lavish launch parties. It wasn’t all hype, however, as this turned out to be the tastiest Cohiba we smoked all year. The cigar scored well, and would have appeared higher on the list had it not been for its restrictive price and limited availability."

Is it the eye-catching red band? Is it the cigar’s reputation for being more full bodied than most other Cubans? Whatever the reason, this perennial crowd pleaser maintained high quality this year, rising above other Cuban cigars for its ability to consistently deliver a flavorful smoking experience, despite its high production numbers.

The Partagás Alphabet Series started in the 1930s with many different sizes, but by the 1970s, the Serie D No. 4 was the only remaining remnant of the line. Then, in 2005, Habanos revisited the series, eventually adding four sizes. The red bands haven’t really changed much over the years, and yet the cigars, with their simple, streamlined lettering still seem fresh and modern. Part of that has to do with the introduction of the tubos, which are sold in handy three-packs. This red-on-black presentation gives the brand a sleek appearance and was a smart marketing decision by Habanos. Smart packaging only goes so far. The Serie D No. 4 lives up to appearances with its explosion of flavor from the first puff, showing a palate of leather, minerals and wood, sweeter notes of orange and vanilla, as well as a lasting hazelnut finish."

Since its release in 2002, the Siglo VI still shimmers with undeniable star power. At the time, it was the thickest Cohiba in the line. It was also the first cigar to be sold in a glossy, pop-top, lipstick style tube. Called a cañonazo—or cannon shot—in Cuban cigar factories, the size was conceived solely for the Siglo VI. Twenty years later, retailers still have a difficult time keeping this cigar in stock, despite its high price.

Casually referred to as the “Siglo Series” this line of Cohiba is officially called Línea 1492 and is blended to be a bit milder than the core Cohiba line, or Línea Clásica. According to Habanos, two aspects make Cohiba special. Firstly, some of the filler leaf undergoes additional fermentation time in barrels. Secondly, Cohiba’s tobacco is purportedly harvested from the five finest farms in Vuelta Abajo, Cuba’s famed growing region located in the western province of Pinar del Río.

If Cohiba is Cuba’s flagship brand, then the Siglo VI might very well be Cohiba’s flagship size, and for good reason. The nutty cigar brims with espresso, brown sugar and dried berries before a rich chocolate finish."

"Punch Short de PunchJan 01, 2021",95,"4 3/4""",50,Medium,Robusto,"It had been decades since the Cuban Punch brand saw a new size in its regular-production portfolio, but at the 2019 Habanos Festival, a most unexpected announcement was made: Punch was getting a robusto. This was particularly exciting news for Punch fans for a number of reasons. First, there was the sheer novelty of any addition to the brand whatsoever, as Habanos had only been deleting Punch sizes over the years, not adding them. But secondly, Punch was a rarity among Cuban cigar brands, one that never had a robusto in its regular portfolio, so the advent of the Short de Punch created much buzz among Habanophiles.

As it turned out, the cigar more than lived up to the hype—it’s one of the finest Cuban Punches we’ve encountered in years. Each puff brings all the warm qualities of holiday baking from nutmeg and oatmeal cookies to pecans and graham cracker, but there’s a spicy hint of hot chili oil tying it all together in unexpected ways. 

Over the last decade, Cuban Punches have come and gone, either appearing as Regional Editions or the occasional Edición Limitada. Some of them have even been released in the robusto format, but production was small, availability was limited to a particular country and none of them were ever as good (or as accessible) as the Short de Punch."
"Bolivar Belicoso FinoJan 01, 2021",95,"5 1/2""",52,Medium-Full,Figurado,"It’s strong, it’s earthy and it’s a go-to cigar for those who want a powerful Cuban. We’re talking, of course, about the Bolivar Belicoso Fino, Cuba’s quintessential full-bodied figurado. Simply calling it earthy is an understatement, as the smoke is more sophisticated, with a foundation built upon a base of earth, cocoa and coffee bean that supports notes of red pepper and leather. 

The Belicoso Fino is also one of the few Cubans to come packaged in both dress boxes and wooden cabinets. The cigars we rated so highly came from cabs. And while aging a cigar usually rounds out and matures the flavor, those looking for heavier impact might do better to smoke these now."
"Ramon Allones Allones No. 2 Edición Limitada 2019Jan 01, 2021",92,"5 1/2""",52,Medium-Full,Figurado,"A Cuban Edición Limitada hasn’t appeared on our Top 25 since 2012, but the Ramon Allones Allones No. 2 proved to be one of the finest ELs we’ve had in years. Like all cigars in Cuba’s limited-edition program, the Ramon Allones is covered in a darker, higher-priming wrapper than usual and rolled in a unique size normally not found within the brand.

The cigar was a year behind schedule and didn’t start reaching retail outlets until October 2020. Habanos was never clear as to what the hold-up was, but with the cigar’s big meaty character and sweeter notes of cocoa powder, almond and cinnamon, it was worth the wait."

"COHIBA ROBUSTO Jan 01, 2020",95,"4 7/8""",50,Medium-Full,Robusto,"No brand in the premium cigar world has more recognition or fanfare than Cuba's Cohiba. Even people who don't smoke cigars know the name, and while too much hype often leads to unrealistic expectations, the Cohiba Robusto more than lives up to its lofty reputation.When Cohiba was born in 1966, it had only one size, a long, thin Lancero created for Fidel Castro's personal consumption. In 1982, when the brand went on sale in Spain, it was expanded to three sizes. It wasn't until 1989 that the Robusto was added, coinciding with the cigar brand's global sales debut. At the time, the Robusto was the thickest size in Cohiba's portfolio.Now 30 years later, the Cohiba Robusto is still in high demand and can still command high prices at retail. According to Habanos, only the highest-grade tobacco from the five finest farms in Cuba's Vuelta Abajo zone are selected for Cohibas, but the Cuban monopoly won't name the plantations. The only thing we can verify with certainty is that Cohiba Robustos are sophisticated and delicious smokes, powerful cigars with notes of oak, vanilla and almonds. There's a reason why people have been buying them with passion for so long."
"JUAN LOPEZ  SELECCIÓN NO. 2Jan 01, 2020",93,"4 7/8""",50,Medium-Full,Robusto,"Perhaps Cuban monopoly Habanos S.A. has decided to marginalize this brand, but if you're a serious smoker, we suggest you give the Juan Lopez Selección No. 2 your full attention. Juan Lopez might be one of the lesser-known Cuban brands in production, but the Selección No. 2 is one of the best robustos from Cuba we smoked all year. Sadly, it's one of only two sizes still left in the line.Obviously, Juan Lopez has enough of a following to justify its existence, but as Habanos seems to concentrate more on its larger, global brands, one can't help but wonder about the future of tasty gems like this that blossom with notes of dried fruit, roasted chestnuts and salted caramel."
"HOYO DE MONTERREY  LE HOYO DE RÍO SECOJan 01, 2020",92,"5 1/2""",56,Medium,Toro,"There's no denying that Cuban cigars are getting thicker while thinner, traditional sizes are disappearing. The Hoyo de Monterrey Le Hoyo de Río Seco is a perfect example. At a ring gauge of 56, it's the thickest regular-production cigar to come out of Cuba. Habanos began fattening its Le Hoyo series in 2014 with the Le Hoyo de San Juan (54 ring). Four years later, it came out with this hefty smoke.The Río Seco represents a modern way to experience Cuban cigars—one that allows for more tobacco and, ideally, more expression of Cuba's terroir. Whether you like heavy ring gauges or not, the Río Seco inarguably delivers impressions of cinnamon, nutmeg, oak and caramel that are nuanced and delicious."

"H. UPMANN SIR WINSTONJan 01, 2019",94,"7""",47,Medium,Churchill,"One of the last Cuban Churchills in the Habanos S.A. portfolio is the H. Upmann Sir Winston. It doesn't seem right that such a classic format has been deleted from almost every Cuban brand, but the trend is leaning towards fatter, shorter cigars. We at Cigar Aficionado have lamented this tragedy before, but there's no sense in wasting too much time on what's been lost. Rather, let's focus on the Sir Winston.Its dimensions, 7 inches by 47 ring gauge, are nearly perfect. It's thick enough to deliver ample smoke, thin enough to fit comfortably in your mouth and long enough to give you at least an hour of pleasurable smoking. It's medium bodied, making it approachable for beginners but complex enough for more experienced smokers. The cigar is brimming with refined chocolate, marzipan, floral notes and a sweet, graham cracker finish, all brought together by that unique, inimitable Cuban taste.The size is known as a Julieta No. 2 in Cuban cigar factories, and was a favorite of Winston Churchill, perhaps the most famous cigar smoker in history. He consumed so many Julieta No. 2 cigars that the grand and elegant size was eventually named after him. It's only proper that the H. Upmann Sir Winston happens to be a Churchill. "
"QUAI D'ORSAY NO. 54Jan 01, 2019",93,"5 3/8""",54,Medium-Full,Odd,"Created in the 1970s exclusively for the French market, the old Quai d'Orsay brand came in a handful of sizes and was considered a fairly mild to medium-bodied smoke. But the Cuban cigar monopoly recently launched a completely new Quai d'Orsay, transforming it from a regional cigar to a global brand. The bands and boxes were redesigned, the line was given two new sizes—thicker vitolas intended to appeal to a larger market—and the cigar was reblended, giving it more character. Now, the brand can be found all over the world, and we found the No. 54 to be quite remarkable. While today's Quai d'Orsay is different, it's still no powerhouse, but a subtle and refined Cuban cigar that's one part sweet and one part savory like a salted caramel praline."

It has scored in the 90s repeatedly in our tastings since it was introduced in 2004. When it first came to market, the Siglo VI entered some new ground for Cohiba. At the time, this was the fattest Cohiba ever launched (the size is called Cañonazo in Cuban cigar factories) and it was the first Cuban cigar to showcase the new ""lipstick"" style, pull-top aluminum tube. It's not the strongest Cohiba, as the Siglo series is lighter than the core Cohiba line, but the Siglo VI is by no means mild, nor inexpensive. According to Habanos, the best tobacco in Cuba is reserved for the brand, and that lofty claim is reflected in the price."

And as more Americans get the chance to sample Cuban cigars (due to the relaxed restrictions on their purchase), Bolivar is often a preferred choice on account of its fuller body. While it isn't one of Cuba's largest brands, it certainly has a very long history and a loyal, international following.Sadly, there aren't many sizes in the Bolivar portfolio left to choose from, and only two of them are large cigars. There's the Royal Corona, which has previously won Cigar of the Year, and then the Belicoso Fino, a beautifully tapered smoke crafted with a signature earthy core and plenty of sweet, savory notes ranging from salt and nuts to chocolate and graham cracker.The cigar is indeed strong and earthy, but do not mistake that for crude or rustic—each element of flavor is conveyed to the palate in measured, balanced layers. And, unlike most Cuban cigars, the Bolivar Belicoso Fino comes in both dress boxes and wooden cabinets, which are a bit more difficult to find. For this tasting, we sampled cigars from the slide-lid cedar cabinets, and yes, there was the welcome hint of cedar as well."
"PARTAGÁS LUSITANIAJan 01, 2018",93,"7 5/8""",49,Medium,Double Corona,"The Partagás Lusitania has been around long enough to be considered one of Cuba's iconic and classic cigars. In 2017, it was one of the finest cigars we smoked. But double coronas like the Lusitania require a particularly large, pristine tobacco leaf to fully cover all seven and a half inches of the cigar. Inconsistent crops and poor weather in the last few years have created a bit of a shortage of large, high-quality wrapper leaf in Cuba. This did not stop Cuba from producing fantastic Lusitanias. Our samples came from a 10-count box with a December 2016 box code, so somehow these lovely smokes have not been plucked up by aficionados in the know. These Lusitanias begin floral and sweet before imparting layers of leather, cedar and almonds."

Today, Romeo has a regular Churchill, Petit Churchill and Wide Churchill, but the one to look out for is the Short Churchill. While the others are fine cigars, this year, none impressed us as much as the Short. It's the size of a standard robusto and a complex composition of ripe apple, red wine and sweet toffee, all tied together by a rich, toasty undertone. The flavors are clear and pronounced but not at all overwhelming, nor are they competing for dominance."

At 54 ring gauge, it's clearly part of Cuba's recent initiative to make its cigars larger and fatter in general. Traditionalists might scoff at the beefed-up parameters, but it would be a mistake as Habanos has loaded this cigar with plenty of fine, complex tobacco.The Partagás Alphabet Series dates back to the 1930s, when the brand first appeared on the British market. When it debuted, the line included Series A through D with four sizes assigned to each letter, for a total of 16 sizes. The brand was discontinued in the 1960s but brought back incrementally in subsequent years. All cigars in the letter series are dressed in a distinctive red-and-gold band that separates them from the core Cuban Partagás cigar line.For years, fans of the Partagás letter series only had the Serie D No. 4 to enjoy, but Habanos has taken a new interest in the Partagás sub-brand and added a number of new sizes over the last few years. The Serie E No. 2 was released in 2011, but the samples with a box date of August 2016 mark the most impressive Cuban of the year."
"HOYO DE MONTERREY EPICURE NO. 2Jan 01, 2017",93,"4 7/8""",50,Medium,Robusto,"If there is a quintessential Cuban robusto, the Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure No. 2 probably holds that title. The size has been around for decades and is a favorite among fans of Cuban cigars for its delicate nuance, complexity and aroma. Not that this is a mild cigar. Subtlety and mild body aren't exactly the same thing, and the Epicure No. 2 is a case study in how a cigar can deliver layers of flavor while preserving delicacy and sophistication. The samples we smoked were from a February 2016 production date.Traditionalists should be happy that not too much has changed in terms of presentation over the years. The Hoyo Epicure No. 2 cigars still come packaged in wooden slide-lid cabinets, which are ideal for air-flow during long-term aging. They still come bundled with a ribbon, and the cigars are even offered in 50-count cabinets as an option to standard boxes of 25. The only major change has been the bands. Up until about 10 years ago, many cigars in wooden cabinets were packaged nude. Habanos S.A. changed that by putting bands on all cigars, cabinet or otherwise. Those who wish to pay homage to the past can simply remove the labels with ease."
"COHIBA SIGLO VI (TUBO)Jan 01, 2017",93,"5 7/8""",52,Medium,Toro,"There are a lot of ""firsts"" surrounding the Cohiba Siglo VI. It was the first addition to the Linea 1492 (or Siglo Series) since the brand was released. It was the first Cohiba in a tube. It was the first tube with the two-part, pull-cap design to come out of Cuba. It was the first Cohiba to exceed a ring gauge of 50. And it was also the first Cohiba to be on Cigar Aficionado's Top 25 list, making its inaugural appearance for the best cigars of 2004.Despite the long list of firsts, the Siglo VI is also a fantastic cigar. Many are made at El Laguito, which is Cohiba's mother factory, and even though the ring gauge is fairly heavy, Siglo VI cigars only have half a leaf of ligero tobacco in the blend, so the smoke has body, but isn't too powerful. Balance in blending is a difficult act, but necessary, especially with Cohiba—probably the most famous cigar name in the world."

"RAMON ALLONES SPECIALLY SELECTEDJan 01, 2016",96,"4 7/8""",50,Medium-Full,Robusto,"When it comes to Cuban cigars Ramon Allones isn't exactly a household name, as it's one of the smaller brands coming out of Cuba, but Habanophiles know it well. It's also a cigar that fans of more full-bodied tobacco tend to reach for, and the Specially Selected is probably the most recognized vitola in the Ramon Allones portfolio. Not that the portfolio is terribly large—over the years, official deletions have whittled down the brand to a mere three sizes.Ramon Allones is as rich in history as it is in flavor. Founded in 1837, it's one of the oldest brands still produced and is credited as the first manufacturer to decorate its boxes with ornate, branded labels. Other cigar companies naturally followed suit and now, more than 150 years later, the branding of cigars and cigar boxes is commonplace.What is less common, however, is the amount of complex character that the Ramon Allones Specially Selected delivers. The cigars we originally smoked and rated earlier in the year were from a box stamped with a 2013 production date. The Specially Selected cigars we revisited for the Top 25 test were from 2014—and they were quite magnificent. Forget, for a moment, that these cigars are supposed to be strong and rustic by reputation. While there is indeed an intensity to these cigars, the Ramon Allones Specially Selected smokes of 2014 are also dynamic and, at times, elegant. Each puff is layered with earthy espresso bean but notes of marzipan and citrus show the cigar's more sophisticated side."
"BOLIVAR BELICOSO FINOJan 01, 2016",94,"5 1/2""",52,Full,Figurado,"Perhaps the single most consistently full-bodied smoke that Cuba produces, the Bolivar Belicoso Fino is a perennial favorite for those favoring strong Cuban smokes. It's named after Simon Bolivar, who lead the effort to liberate much of South America from Spain. Consider him the George Washington of America's Southern hemisphere. The brand was created in 1902 and features a bold, prominent portrait of the man on both the bands and the boxes.The Belicoso Fino is the only figurado in the Bolivar line, which is probably why it registers as the strongest smoke across the brand. The fairly heavy ring gauge provides an abundance of smoke while the tapered head concentrates it before it reaches the palate, resulting in an elementally earthy smoke, heavy in minerals, raw cocoa and coffee bean. But the tapered head also adds a piquancy to the already full-bodied cigar.Strong and earthy, Bolivar Belicoso Finos are offered in both wooden slide-lid cabinets and paper-lined dress boxes. Some believe that the cedary environment of cabinets are ideal for long-term aging, while others prefer the neutrality of paper. The cigars we smoked for this test were from traditional dress boxes (with a March 2015 production stamp), so they were packaged as 13 cigars on the top row, 12 cigars on the bottom, causing the tightly packed Belicosos to take on the kind of squarish, box-pressed appearance that cannot be achieved in a cabinet."
"TRINIDAD VIGÍAJan 01, 2016",94,"4 3/8""",54,Medium-Full,Odd,"Trinidad is one of the anomalies within Cuba's collection of cigar brands. It started as a commercially unavailable cigar reserved for diplomats and dignitaries. Once the brand was released to the public in 1998, it came in one long, thin size called Fundadores. Then the brand expanded by adding a few more vitolas, only to contract afterward by deleting sizes in 2012. Trinidad's newest addition, the Vigía is the exact opposite of the Fundadores. Rather than being long and slender, this cigar is short and squat. While it maintains Trinidad's signature pigtail cap, its heavy ring gauge offers an abundant smoke, lush with earthy truffle notes, oakiness and a warm nutty finish. Vigía is named for the watchtowers in the Cuban city of Trinidad erected to observe the sugarcane fields."

The Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure Especial was introduced to the main Cuban cigar portfolio at the Habanos Festival in 2008. The idea was to give the aficionado more, building on the success of the iconic Hoyo Epicure No. 2, a robusto measuring 4 7/8 inches long by 50 ring. The Epicure Especial, offering another 5/8 of an inch of smoking pleasure, was previously teased an Edición Limitada in 2004. We had mixed feelings about the smoke when it was an EL, giving it scores of 85 and 90 points, but we have always been impressed by the regular production smoke, rating it several times between 89 and 94 points. We have been most wowed by the version packed in a tube.Most Cuban cigars come in boxes, but if you want the tubed variety of this Hoyo, it is offered only in three packs, making it somewhat peculiar in the Habanos portfolio.The cigar is very, very rich, with varied notes that include coffee, earth and cocoa powder, and a touch of graham cracker. It's complex, but not too strong, making it a very approachable Cuban."

Recent production Cohiba Esplendidos show off rich, full-bodied flavors, such as salted caramel, black cherry and baked apple.

Fat and distinctive, Edmundo was an immediate hit, prompting new sizes such as the short and plump Petit Edmundo in early 2007 and this Double Edmundo (which is longer, but not fatter, than the Edmundo) in 2013.

The stately smoke with the pointy tip is known the world over and ranks as one of the best-selling cigars in the Cuban cigar portfolio. And unlike some things that sell well, Monte 2s combine commercial success with critical acclaim. We have rated Montecristo No. 2s dozens of times in Cigar Aficionado blind tastings. The first time was more than 20 years ago, when we gave it a score of 94 points. This score of 96 is the highest rating we have ever bestowed on the cigar in a blind taste test. Recent production Monte 2s (those we smoked were from April 2013) are extraordinary, teeming with rich but not overwhelming flavors of leather, such sweet spices as cinnamon and nutmeg and the cigar's trademark tangy wood note. They have enough flavor and power to satisfy those who smoke cigars on a regular basis without overwhelming those who puff less frequently.The Montecristo No. 2 is anything but new. The cigar is one of the original sizes of the Montecristo brand, which was created in Cuba by Alonso Menendez in 1935 and became the best-known of all the cigars rolled at Menendez, Garcia y Cia., the biggest cigar company in pre-Castro Cuba. The Count of Monte Cristo, the 1844 work of French novelist Alexandre Dumas that culminates in a dramatic sword fight, is believed to have inspired the name. Today, the Montecristo box features swords crossed in a triangular pattern, and the band has a majestic fleur-de-lis, a symbol of the French monarchy, in its center. While Montecristo No. 2s smoke beautifully in their youth, they also make superb aging cigars for those with the patience. We have smoked Montecristos that have been stored for 10 to 50 years in a humidor, and they only get better over time. The Montecristo No. 2 is a classic, and Cigar Aficionado's  best cigar of 2013.

"COHIBA BEHIKE BHK 54Jan 01, 2014",94,"5 3/4""",54,Medium-Full,Toro,"Say the name Behike and cigar lovers perk up their ears. Cigar Aficionado crowned the Cohiba Behike BHK 52 Cigar of the Year in 2010, heaping praise on the chubby, pigtailed smoke. While we've never truly embraced the largest of the trio, the BHK 56, we've always given good scores to the middle cigar of the bunch, the 54. Tasting it again this year, we feel the Cohiba BHK 54 is smoking better than ever. All Cohiba Behikes are said to be made with a bit of medio tiempo tobacco, small leaves that grow at the very top of some, but not all, Cuban-seed tobacco plants. That filler component, which once was heaped in with other ligeros, or strong tobaccos, today is separated and fermented on its own, and used as a special ingredient in the Behike blend. The result is a bold, leathery smoke with a solid earthy core and pleasant notes of coffee bean. This Behike is rich, flavorful and eminently memorable. Cohiba Behike BHK 54s are among the most expensive of Cuban cigars, but when they deliver this type of standout flavor, we believe they are worth the expense."

No, it's not a Behike or a Siglo VI, but a thick cañonazo extra (as they're called in the factory), and the cigar really impressed us with its profound coffee bean flavor and even combustion. As the cigar progressed, it was creamy in the right places, leathery in the right places and rounded out the savory aspects with a milk chocolate sweetness.The 1966 commemorates Cohiba's 45th anniversary and is named for the year that Cohiba was created, when it was Fidel Castro's personal smoke and only available through diplomatic channels. Cohiba did not become commercially available until 1982 and the Edición Limitada program didn't officially begin until 2000. Unlike most other Cohibas, the 1966 is only available on a limited basis. The wrapper is darker than those usually found on Cubans, which is typical of cigars released for the limited-edition program and one of its defining characteristics. As these are destined to be a hot auction item, one might conceivably purchase any remaining boxes as an investment, but as this Cohiba 1966 really represents everything we love about Cuban cigars from its flavor to its richness to the overall harmonious and aromatic experience, it is better to smoke them than to sell them."
"H. UPMANN ROYAL ROBUSTOJan 01, 2013",94,"5 3/8""",52,Medium,Robusto,"Cuban cigars are getting fatter, and the Cuban Edmundo size—5 3/8 inches long by 52 ring—is akin to a longer, fatter robusto. It works beautifully in this new H. Upmann Royal Robusto, a chunky cigar unveiled at the 2011 Habanos Festival in Cuba and brought to market later that year as an exclusive for sale in Casas del Habano stores around the world. (Note the secondary band bearing the Casa del Habano logo.) There are some 140 such stores around the globe, making the cigar not terribly hard to find, which is a good thing.The cigar has a fine, lush draw, which delivers big notes of earth, coffee bean and concentrated minerals before a long and oaky finish. Those who believe Cuban Upmanns are milder smokes should think again—these cigars have some oomph.In 2011 the H. Upmann Havana location was moved to the Romeo y Julieta factory, where H. Upmann workers and supervisors hung up their own banner and began rolling, while their own factory was renovated. The H. Upmann Royal Robusto was one of the first new smokes they rolled in their new, albeit temporary, home."

The cigar, originally called the Partagás Pirámide, was released in 2000, scoring in the high 80s in our publications. The popular smoke was made part of the regular Cuban cigar portfolio, and was renamed the Serie P No. 2, again scoring in the upper 80s. In recent years, however, these cigars have gone from good to great. Versions in 2006 scored 90 points, the scores crept up to 91 points by 2009, and last year the cigar scored even higher. In this tasting, it scored a near classic 94 points.The cigar shares the same dimensions as all of Cuba's pirámides, and the Partagás Serie P No. 2 is currently smoking better than all of them, even the legendary Montecristo No. 2. Brimming with black pepper, coffee bean, leather and sweet cappuccino notes, the cigars are powerful and complex, loaded with bold Cuban flavors. This Partagás smoke shows true evolution: it has been transformed into something incredible, a perfect example of the level of top-quality smokes that are being made in Cuba today."
"PUNCH DOUBLE CORONAJan 01, 2012",93,"7 5/8""",49,Full,Double Corona,"Cuban double coronas went through an inconsistent period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Today, they are superb, rivaling their days of glory before the modern-day cigar boom. The stately size, measuring 7 5/8 inches long with a ring gauge of 49, is known as a prominente in Cuban cigar factories. Double coronas are cigars that should never be rushed, something to be lit only when you are going to be free of interruptions and can truly enjoy all that they have to offer. The mother factory for Cuba's Punch brand is La Corona, a cigar factory located near Havana's largest baseball stadium. The factory has a tasting room where workers come in every morning, sit at a small desk, and light up, filling out forms to ensure the previous day's production tastes as it should. Quality control of this nature—along with a less rushed atmosphere in which to make cigars, more draw testing in the factory and better tobacco—are among the reasons that Punch Double Coronas are so delicious to smoke. They build in flavor and complexity. First you will taste the coffee, then dark fruits and some vanilla, then nuts, then more. Complexity, balance, power—the Punch Double has it all. The cigars also age beautifully, only adding to their allure. "

(The other is the Punch Double Corona, which ranked No. 8.) Massive and stately, Hoyo Doubles have built up quite the repuation over the years. Aside from some bad showings in 2001 and 2002, when Cuban cigar production as a whole was inconsistent, Hoyo de Monterrey Double Coronas have scored in the 90s in Cigar Aficionado and Cigar Insider blind tastings, outstanding on our 100-point-scale. Recent production Hoyo Doubles are all about medium-bodied flavors. They offer a combination of sweet spices, coffee notes and a touch of orange peel. These are sublime, rich, but not-too-powerful smokes that are perfect for whiling away an afternoon."

One of the fine things about the H. Upmann brand is its small size. Many of Cuba's biggest cigar brands—Cohiba, Romeo y Julieta, Montecristo—are too large in production to be made in only one place, but all H. Upmanns are rolled at the H. Upmann Factory, which is now located in the building that once was the old Romeo y Julieta Factory. José Miguel Barzaga Maceo is the factory manager, ensuring quality control over the smokes.

"COHIBA BEHIKE BHK 52Jan 01, 2011",97,"4 3/4""",52,Medium,Robusto,"In 2010, which will likely go down as the year of the Cuban cigar, we smoked many fine Havana-made smokes, from majestic double coronas to bracing robustos, and found the quality of Cuban cigars to be at its best since the mid-1990s. And no cigar from Cuba—or from anywhere else for that matter—impressed our tasting panel as much as the Cohiba Behike BHK 52. This is a classic cigar. The shortish, fat smoke, made with an artful pigtail and clad in gorgeous Colorado wrapper of reddish brown, is a phenomenally rich, delicious smoke that more than lives up to the reputation of cigars with the name Cohiba. It is the finest cigar to come out of Cuba in a long time, and Cigar Aficionado's top cigar of 2010. A new cigar that was unveiled in February 2010 at the Habanos Festival in Cuba, the Behike BHK 52 has made its way to markets around the world since its launch in London in May. It is the thinnest in a trio of new sizes, all of which have tidy little pigtail caps and names that include their ring gauges. The Behike BHK 52 is a petit robusto, a size known as a Laguito No. 4 in Cuban cigar factories, and it wowed our tasting panel from the get-go. In a vertical brand tasting in the June 8 Cigar Insider the BHK 52 scored 94 points, the best of a trio that includes the BHK 54 and the very fat BHK 56. The 52 has remained delicious ever since, performing admirably in taste test after taste test as they have sold out in world markets. Cohiba has long been a marquis name in Cuban cigars. This new smoke has done what no special release Cohiba has done before: win critical acclaim as well as commercial success. The original Cohiba Behike from 2006 was unavailable to nearly all smokers—only 4,000 cigars were released at a price of $400 or more per cigar. The Cohiba Siglo VI Grand Reserva debuted in 2009 at a price of about £85 ($130), with only 75,000 cigars produced. The Behike BHK 52 combines the excitement of those rare Cohibas with a much larger production goal—150,000 in 2011. The Cuban cigar industry will continue to make batches of it every year in the stately El Laguito factory. Cohiba Behike BHK cigars are made with a portion of filler tobacco known as medio tiempo, a type of sun-grown tobacco leaf that grows at the top of some, but not all tobacco plants. The cigars show great balance even in youth, with a medium to full body, creamy coffee flavors and some earthiness. They show elements of Cuban cigars of old, and should get even better with age—if you can be patient. "
"H. UPMANN NO. 2Jan 01, 2011",94,"6 1/8""",52,Medium,Figurado,"If Cuba's best-known torpedo is the Montecristo No. 2, perhaps the country's best-kept secret is the H. Upmann No. 2. An insider's cigar, the H. Upmann No. 2 is a carbon copy of the ubiquitous Monte, sharing the same stately appearance, with its proud, pointed head and substantial 52 ring gauge. Cuba makes fewer H. Upmanns than Montecristos, so the Upmann is a harder find, but well worth the search, with a solid core of earthy flavor, nuts and coffee beans. These are hearty smokes, and for the past three years they have performed consistently well in our blind tastings. The H. Upmann brand is one of the oldest in the cigar world, dating back to 1844. The brand was born as the brainchild of a British banker named Herman Upmann (or Hupmann, depending on what you read). From his legacy, it seems that Mr. Upmann was a better cigar man than he was a banker, something that the cigar world truly appreciates."

Unofficially, the cigar line was started to replace the famous Davidoff Chateau series that was discontinued in 1991 along with the rest of the Swiss-based cigar merchant's range. Production has been confined almost exclusively to the rolling rooms of the Partagas factory across the street from Havana's capitol building. The Siglo V— called dalias in the rolling rooms—is the longest of the five smokes, identical in size to the ever-popular Partagas 8-9-8. However, the cigar delivers a richer and more refined character because of the special handling given to the tobacco for all Cohiba cigars. The filler and wrapper leaves are selected from the best plantations in Pinar del Río and then processed in a more precise way. The main point is that some of the filler tobacco undergoes a small, special fermentation process while it is held in Havana after being shipped in bales from tobacco warehouses in the provinces. The late Avelino Lara, who ran the Cohiba factory when the Siglo quintet was launched, called it ""the special of the special for Cohiba."" The Siglo V Tubo was the best Cohiba and best Cuban cigar we reviewed in 2009."

However, it wasn't until late 2000 that the marque made a pirámide commercially available with the launch of the Partagas Edición Limitada Pirámide. It took another five years for it to become a core shape. Made at the Partagas factory in Havana, the smoke has always delivered the benchmark rich, earthy, almost funky character that the facility is known for.

We said then that the Short Churchill was ""destined to be another classic,"" and we were right. It's one of those ""go to"" Cuban cigars that never disappoint, and it's incredibly popular in the global market at the moment. It's proving more popular than the RyJ Churchill, which had been an icon cigar for decades from Cuba. Production at the H. Upmann factory— the newest export factory on the island—is finally up to capacity, and the cigar seems to be getting better and better, even richer to our taste than on release. It also comes in tubes, which makes it convenient to throw in your pocket if you are going out for the night. The cigar traditionally comes with an almost claro, or light-brown, wrapper, and its red, white and gold livery. The cigar delivers full-bodied flavor yet remains balanced and refined. Leather, cocoa bean and wood abound, and are punctuated with an almost citrus element."

It's not that their quality has diminished: they still deliver loads of flavor with a cool, refined character. The problem is that few people have the time to smoke such a large cigar as the Sir Winston—let alone such longer ones as double coronas. But aficionados who do opt for a large cigar usually puff on a Romeo y Julieta Churchill or a Cohiba Esplendido. Perhaps that's why Cuba makes so few Sir Winstons, most of which are rolled in the new H. Upmann factory on the outskirts of Havana. Until the mid-1990s, the cigar came in a smart green lacquered box, but today it comes in a varnished cedar one with a clasp. The band, once the standard brown and white H. Upmann, is now gold, white and red. Find some time if you are going to smoke this. It's worth relaxing and contemplating what the Sir Winston has to offer. It's so good to look at that you may not want to see it go up in smoke. The ones we smoked had beautiful silky, oily wrappers and excellent caps. The first puffs were immediately rich with leather and spice, then developed into woody, meaty undertones. This cigar has the richness and structure to age well. We think that Winston Churchill would have loved this cigar."

We love the oily and dark brown wrappers. The cigars draw and burn beautifully with a medium to full body, reminiscent of a Bordeaux wine with savory leather and tea notes. Selección No. 2 comes packaged in cedar cabinets of 25 sticks. From our experience, this cigar always improves with box age.

The cigars have always impressed us with their lovely aromatic qualities of dried flowers and delicate tobacco. The La Fuerza is essentially a slightly elongated robusto, called gordito, or fatty, in the factory. The cigar delivers plenty of rich earth and coffee flavors that evolve to leather and mahogany undertones. The cigar is certainly rightly named at the moment.

Current production is overseen at the Partagas factory, and only the top rollers are allowed to make the cigars.

At one time, production of the cigar was limited to the H. Upmann factory in Old Havana, but the cigar's recent popularity has caused Habanos to expand its production to other key export factories in the city, and today about 3 million Montecristo No. 2s are made each year. The new H. Upmann factory in Nueva Vedado oversees the production of the cigar, and only top-ranked rollers on the island are allowed to make it. The Montecristo No. 2 has always been a favorite of the CIGAR AFICIONADO editors. It was one of the magazine's star cigars in a 1992 article on the best cigars of Cuba, and it has ranked highly in just about every tasting for the magazine ever since. The 6 1/8-inch x 52-ring cigar is one of the most flavorful, best drawing smokes ever. It delivers loads of earthy and tobacco character with a full body and lots of spicy undertones. It's great to smoke now, but will improve with age. We have had 50-year-old Monte No. 2s that were still rich, cedary and delicious to smoke."

The Cubans launched the maduro range for their most famous brand in early 2007 with three sizes: Genios, 5 1/2 inches by 52 ring; Mágicos, 4 1/2 inches by 52 ring; and Secretos, 4 1/3 inches by 40. It was the smallest that really blew us away with complex flavors of coffee, leather, almonds and caramel. It's a full-bodied smoke with a big heart for a little cigar. It's like comparing a rich espresso with a simple filtered coffee. The Cubans claim to be using fiveyear- old wrapper for these cigars. The top leaves on the plants (called coronas) are picked later than normal to assure that the tobacco is as rich and ripe as possible. The tobacco is then fermented longer to give more color and flavor to the leaf. Almost all the Cohiba Maduro 5s are made in the Partagas factory in Old Havana near the capitol building."

Only 4 1/3 inches by 52 ring in size, this little blockbuster delivers an opulent palate full of rich cocoa bean, sweet earth and pleasant floral notes that crescendo to a long, nutty finish. Smoking it is almost like drinking a rich, decadent Chinese tea. This cigar was created in the new H. Upmann factory in Nuevo Vedado in 2006 following the success of the Hoyo de Monterrey Petit Robusto. The Petit Edmundo is essentially a shortened version of the highly successful Montecristo Edmundo, which is 52 ring by 5 1/3 inches. The petit is actually stronger and more flavorful than the original. In fact, it's hard to think of a cigar from Cuba that packs so much flavor in such a little format."

That all changed in the last five or six years as consumer tastes evolved to shorter and fatter cigars. What remained the same is the 7 5/8-inch x 49-ring cigar's astonishingly good taste, which offers cocoa and coffee bean flavors that are complex with toasty, leathery undertones. It's a medium-bodied smoke, perhaps less powerful than it was a decade ago, but the tempered strength is more than made up for in finesse and refinement. Most of the Punch Double Coronas are made by top-ranked rollers in the new La Corona factory on the outskirts of Havana. Recent visits to key factories suggest that the cigars are now produced in very limited quantities due to waning demand."

Regardless of size, the brand offers rich, powerful cigars that often need a few years of aging to come into their best. At the moment, Bolivar Belicoso Finos from 1993 are smoking fabulously. They have loads of character still, but the almost heady nature of youth has evolved into something extremely complex and satisfying. That sort of special quality is why we chose the Bolivar Royal Corona as Cigar of the Year. The robusto, which measures 4 7/8 inches long by 50 ring gauge, delivers a sophisticated flavor bomb of a smoke with an array of rich character, including touches of chocolate, coffee and leather. The finish is long and it should only get better with age. This year's production illustrates the better quality of the new generation of Habanos. Greater care in production, particularly in some of the new factories in Havana, is bringing the world better Habanos all the time. Current Bolivar RCs seem to take their inspiration from what we consider one of the golden ages for Cuban smokes, the late 1980s and early 1990s. That was when Cuban cigarmakers created and made some of their best cigars. The Bolivar band is not a big one in"

But production at the H. Upmann factory in Havana was always sporadic, so many markets did not receive the cigars, which were sold in both tubes and boxes. For example, at one time the Cubans had the cigars but they didn't have the tubes to ship them. Then they had the tubes and not the cigars. Despite the glitches in establishing the Short Churchill in the market, the robusto, which measures 4 7/8 inches long by 50 ring, is a smooth and rich cigar worth seeking out. It's medium to full bodied and packed with leather and coffee notes and a touch of sweet wood. Considering the popularity of its 7 inch by 47 ring gauge big brother, the Romeo y Julieta Churchill, the brand's new robusto is destined to be another classic that any Cuban cigar lover will enjoy smoking."

The Montecristo Robusto was part of the first batch of Edición Limitadas, which were released in 2001. So this is a re-release to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the line, and we think that the second production is better than ever.

Then Habanos S.A. introduced the Cohiba Siglo VI in the United Kingdom. Dubbed the cañonazo, or ""cannon shot,"" in Cuban cigar factories, the cigar was a new size for Cuba, just under 6 inches long and an impressive 50 ring gauge. The cigar (which also comes in an extraordinary colorful aluminum tube, for an even higher price) brims with strong and intense flavors, loaded with notes of leather and coffee. It's a full-bodied smoke not meant for an inexperienced palate. Cuba tried to replicate its success the following year when it introduced the Montecristo Edmundo, a bit shorter and slightly fatter than the Siglo VI, but it failed to live up to the high standards set by the Cohiba.

Overshadowed by the famous Cuban brands such as Cohiba, Montecristo and Romeo y Julieta, San Cristobal is known only to more learned cigar smokers. The brand—named after Christopher Columbus—was created in 1999, and was originally intended to be a low-end brand made with tobacco from the Remedios region. The cigar was changed, and is made from Cuba's premium leaf, which is evident in the performance of the dark and rich El Morro, the largest of the four-sized line. The 7 1/8-inch, 49-ring Churchill brims with dark, earthy flavors, and the brand is small enough to be made in only one factory, La Corona in Havana."

There are more Monte 2s made per year than any other cigar on this list, and they are rolled in several Cuban cigar factories, so there's the occasional problem with quality and consistency, but at their best Monte 2s are masterpieces of fullbodied flavor, loaded with leather, earth and coffee notes.

Not as famous as any of Cuba's iconic Hoyo or Punch Double Coronas, the benchmark Romeo y Julieta Churchill or the better known Punch Punch corona gorda, the Upmann has come into its own over the past two years. Once scoring in the high 80s, since 2003 the cigar has been rated twice, each time scoring 92 points. Surprisingly strong and wonderfully decadent, the 5 5/8 inch by 46 ring corona gorda was, until recently, one of the Cuban cigars packed naked, without cigar bands, which only added to its low-key mystique.

                                                                                    Rank: 2",93,"5 3/8""",52,,Robusto,"This fat and sassy cigar was introduced in the spring of 2004, but it has only recently begun to come into its own. The cigar measures 5 3/8 inches long by 52 ring gauge and is produced primarily in the H. Upmann factory, which is in the neighborhood of Nuevo Vedado in Havana. Originally, the cigar was rather mild, with a subtle cedary, tobacco character. Some even called it bland. But recent-production Edmundos have shown much more spice and coffee character. It’s as if the Cubans increased the strong tobacco (ligero) in the blend. A discussion with the factory heads at H. Upmann last fall didn’t reveal any changes, although they admitted to keeping an even more watchful eye on production and quality control. Whatever the reason, the cigar is now one of the most exciting coming out of Cuba."
"HOYO DE MONTERREY REGALOS EDICIÓN LIMITADA 2007Nov 30, -0001",92,"5 1/3""",46,Full,Robusto,"Well made with a dark, oily wrapper. The smoke is rich with earth, leather and coffee bean flavors that leave a long, sweet finish. A well-balanced cigar."
"PARTAGAS SERIE D NO. 4 RESERVATop 25 of 2005 |
                                                                                    Rank: 5",92,"4 7/8""",50,,Robusto,"This special-edition robusto made its debut last March during Havana’s annual cigar festival. The standard Partagas Serie D No. 4 is one of the most popular smokes to come out of the island, and this release uses even older tobacco. The 4 7/8 by 50 robusto contains tobacco with a minimum of three years of age and the wrappers are also carefully selected. The cigars, with their special second band of black and silver, come in numbered black lacquered boxes of 20 smokes. Most of them were sold in the Far East, United Kingdom and Switzerland. The cigar reminded many of the editors of Serie Ds from the late 1980s and early 1990s—a golden age for Cuban cigar production. The new robustos are rich and powerful cigars with a decadent, earthy edge that is the hallmark of a good Partagas. These are beautiful smokes now, but will be even better with time in your humidor."
"BOLIVAR PETIT CORONANov 30, -0001",91,"5 1/8""",42,Full,Petit Corona,"It’s hard to find a short cigar that delivers plenty of richness and flavors, even in Cuba. However, the 5 by 42 Bolivar Petit Corona has nearly always delivered just that, with the exception of a bland period from about 1998 to 2002. Don’t buy the product of those years. Current production is a whole different story. We prefer the cigars in cedar cabinets of 50, but those that come in standard paper boxes of 25 are also excellent. Blast one of these babies with your morning java and you’ll understand the meaning of the phrase “size doesn’t matter,” especially with a good Habano."
"H. UPMANN MAGNUM 50 EDICIÓN LIMITADA 2005Nov 30, -0001",90,"6 1/2""",50,,Toro,"Some say that this cigar takes its inspiration from the legendary Por Larrañaga Magnum, which was produced until the 1970s in Cuba. Among cigar collectors few greater cigars exist, and the PL Mags have a profound ability to improve with age. Some of the editors have smoked 40- and even 50-year-old examples that are still wonderful smokes. The Limitada H. Upmann Magnum has the potential to approach such greatness. It’s a powerful, almost raw smoke at the moment, but with patience and plenty of box age the 6 1/2 by 50 cigar will become great. Another limitedproduction, aged, dark-wrappered winner from the island, it was produced only for last year. We would like to see this as a regular vitola in the Cuban stable."
"COHIBA SIGLO IINov 30, -0001",90,"5 1/8""",42,,Corona,"The Siglo line of Cohiba was launched in 1992, but only recently, with the introduction of the Siglo VI in 2004, did the brand really become popular. The Siglo II has always been a serious smoke, but never one that blew off the shelves. We think that the market might have it wrong. The hearty cigar, which resembles the old Davidoff Chateau Margaux, measures 5 inches by 42 ring gauge. It always delivers lots of spicy, creamy character and a bright freshness from the specially processed filler tobacco. The Cubans say that some of the tobacco in the blend goes through a third fermentation, which provides the flavor and the finesse of Cohiba. The Siglo II is a consistently outstanding cigar."
"MONTECRISTO D EDICIÓN LIMITADA 2005Nov 30, -0001",90,"6 3/4""",43,,Lonsdale,"Even while Cuba’s largest brand, Montecristo, is often criticized for having inconsistencies due to its immense production, the special Montes in the annual Edición Limitada program have received nothing but praise. Last year’s release, the slim and elegant D (6 3/4 by 43), packs a punch with its aged dark wrapper and sweet tobacco filler. It’s sort of a supercharged Especial No. 1, and is more than satisfying with its spicy, almost chocolaty character. Most of the cigars are made in the new H. Upmann factory, which opened in November 2003. It’s one of Cuba’s best factories at the moment—modern and well organized to make the best smokes."
"BOLIVAR ROYAL CORONANov 30, -0001",89,"4 7/8""",50,,Robusto,"Good cedar character. It has a medium body with hints of sweet herbs, and a light toasty note."
"FONSECA NO. 1Nov 30, -0001",88,"6 3/8""",43,Medium,,"Oily and reddish brown in appearance, this cigar has a woody, toasty character. The smoke is earthy and medium bodied, with a dry finish. "
